- You can change Frequency and Baud Rate as desired.
- Make sure to change time period of clk in test bench. (For example: 1 Mhz clock = 1 us time period)
- Note that GENERICS defined in top module will always over-write the ones defined in low level modules (For example: UART_TX_RX generics will over-write UART_TX and UART_RX
  generics). So do not get confused as to why I am using 9600 baud rate in transmitter and receiver,
  And 115200 baud rate in top module. 115200 and 2Mhz Frequency from top module will be passed down.
